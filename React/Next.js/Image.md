# Image Component and Image Optimization

**next/image** is an extension of the HTML <img> element, evolved for the modern web.

Next.js also has support for Image Optimization by default. This allows for resizing, optimizing, and serving images in modern formats like WebP when the browser supports it. This avoids shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport. It also allows Next.js to automatically adopt future image formats and serve them to browsers that support those formats.

Automatic Image Optimization works with any image source. Even if the image is hosted by an external data source, like a CMS, it can still be optimized.
