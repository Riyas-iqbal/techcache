# SSL/TLS Layer

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), are cryptographic protocols that provide secure communication over the internet. They are used to encrypt data transmitted between a client and a server, ensuring that the data cannot be intercepted and read by third parties.

SSL and TLS are commonly used in web browsing, email, instant messaging, and other applications that require secure communication. They operate at the transport layer of the OSI model, which means they are responsible for ensuring that data is securely transmitted between two endpoints.

The SSL/TLS protocol uses a combination of asymmetric and symmetric encryption to provide security. When a client and server establish a secure connection, they first negotiate the encryption algorithm and establish a shared secret key that is used to encrypt and decrypt data. This ensures that data transmitted between the client and server is protected from eavesdropping, tampering, and other security threats.

The use of SSL/TLS is essential for secure online transactions such as online banking, e-commerce, and other sensitive data exchange, and it has become an essential part of the modern internet.
