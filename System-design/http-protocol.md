# Http Protocal

HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a protocol that defines how data is exchanged between a client (such as a web browser) and a server over the internet.

When a client requests a web page or other resources from a server, it sends an HTTP request message to the server. The server then responds with an HTTP response message containing the requested data. The data can be in the form of HTML, images, audio or other media types.

HTTP uses a request/response model, where the client sends a request message to the server, and the server responds with a response message containing the requested data or an error message if the request cannot be fulfilled.

HTTP is the foundation of the World Wide Web and is used for a wide variety of applications beyond web browsing, including API services, streaming media, and more.
