# Https - secure

HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure. It is a secure version of HTTP, which means that all data exchanged between a client and server is encrypted and cannot be intercepted by third parties.

HTTPS uses a combination of the standard HTTP protocol and the SSL/TLS protocol to provide encryption and authentication. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), are cryptographic protocols that provide secure communication over the internet.

When a client requests a resource over HTTPS, the server responds with its SSL/TLS certificate, which contains a public key that is used to encrypt the data exchanged between the client and server. The client then uses this public key to encrypt a shared secret key that is used for the remainder of the communication session.

HTTPS is commonly used for secure transactions, such as online banking, e-commerce, and other sensitive data exchange. It ensures that data transmitted between a client and server is private and secure, preventing eavesdropping, tampering, and other security threats.
