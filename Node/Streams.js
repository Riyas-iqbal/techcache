// Streams are a way to handle reading and writing data in a continuous and efficient manner.
// Streams are essentially a way to process data one piece at a time, rather than reading or writing the entire file at once.

// Streams can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as reading data from files or network sockets,
// piping data between different streams, or compressing or encrypting data on the fly. Node.js provides
// several built-in stream classes, such as Readable, Writable, Duplex, and Transform, which can be used
// to create custom stream objects.

// Streams can be used for both reading and writing data. For example, a Readable stream can be used to 
// read data from a file, while a Writable stream can be used to write data to a file. Duplex and Transform
// streams can be used for both reading and writing data.

// One of the advantages of using streams in Node.js is that they can handle large amounts of data without 
// consuming too much memory. Instead of loading the entire file into memory, streams process data in chunks,
// allowing for more efficient memory usage. Additionally, streams can be piped together, allowing data to flow
// from one stream to another without buffering the entire data set in memory.

// Overall, streams is a powerful tool for handling data efficiently and effectively.
